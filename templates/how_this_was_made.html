                        <p>&emsp;This site was primarily organized in two parts.  First, my <a href="https://www.davidterwilliger.com">personal site's</a> flask app was cloned, HTML and CSS was copied from this   <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/simple-sidebar/">twitter bootstrap theme</a>.  Heroku's addon PostgreSQL was added; a python script was written to scrape and store data, data can then be queried and graphed.</p>

     
                        <p>&emsp;<b>Cloning previous site:</b></p>
                        <p>&emsp;Make sure python is upto date, along with any libraries.  Same with <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli">Heroku toolbelt</a>.  I'm fairly sure that my library management with virtual env is a little out of wack.  I believe, that when I originally setup the venv file for my personal site; I was accidently installing lots more packages on that python interpreter.  My python distro may need a complete wipe and re-set to get better organized.</p>





<pre class="prettyprint lang-css linenums">
cd dekstop
brew install heroku
heroku login
heroku git:clone -a myapp
</pre>
<p>&emsp;Rename the folder, cd inside and start venv.</p>


<pre class="prettyprint lang-css linenums">
cd my_project_folder
source venv/bin/activate
</pre>

<p>&emsp;At this point, the cloned python code had many moldule dependancies, which are not necessarily downloaded.  Running the app instantly fails since these libaries are missing.  Modules are installed with pip until failures stop.</p>


<pre class="prettyprint lang-css linenums">
pip install requests
pip install flask
pip install flask-mail
</pre>

<p>&emsp;Once the debugger starts, navigate over to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the local version.  This exact copy is pushed to a new heroku:</p>


<pre class="prettyprint lang-css linenums">
heroku create my_application
git init
heroku apps:create example
git add.
git commit -m "pushing first time"
git push 'enter the heroku git address here' master
</pre>

<p>&emsp;I have two applications on heroku, so the destiantion application within heroku needs to be specified.  Push to github also.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-css linenums">
git remote add origin remote repository URL
git remote -v
git push -u origin master
</pre>
